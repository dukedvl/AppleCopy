# AppleCopy
Quick little ditty to unify Apple subfolders into a common "Total" folder,  useful for backups

Assumes: Copy the "DCIM" folder containing the subfolders (Apple120, Apple121, etc.) over to the current harddrive.  This drastically simplifies the copy-process..  iPhone/iOS USB mass storage accessing, when it isn't a standard drive letter (E:\) is quite a pain.


Does not delete anything in the old folder (No chance for data loss)

Can re-copy the folder, does not overwrite existing files (In case of failures, just restart)

After running, hit "Open" button to view Destination Directory
